Yelp.com is a website operated by an American multinational corporation launched since 2004 which publishes reviews from customers about their experiences with the local businesses by crowd-sourcing manner. The popularity of this site make Yelp to be a platform to connect people with business information, photos, and review content which allow consumers to discover and make transaction with the local businesses. Eventually, Yelp serves as an online big data resource that can be utilized by public for analysis and understand specific business data. With the launch of Yelp Dataset Challenge  , Yelp shares business listings, check-in, tips, reviews and user data which are available in distinct JSON files.

1) Demonstrate the storage of Yelp JSON files using MongoDB and HDFS
2) Demonstrate access of Yelp JSON files from either MongoDB and HDFS to PySpark
