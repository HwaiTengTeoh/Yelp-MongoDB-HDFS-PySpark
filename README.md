# Case Study: Big Data Management using Yelp Data for the use of Retail Sector 

Yelp.com is a website operated by an American multinational corporation launched since 2004 which publishes reviews from customers about their experiences with the local businesses by crowd-sourcing manner. The popularity of this site make Yelp to be a platform to connect people with business information, photos, and review content, allowing consumers to discover and transact with local businesses. Eventually, Yelp will serve as an online big data resource that the public can use to analyze and understand specific business data. With the launch of the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), Yelp shares business listings, check-in, tips, reviews, and user data, which are available in different JSON files. Recently, a new version of the dataset was released, and credits should be given to Yelp's data scientists and engineers who collaborated to maintain the public database. As posted in Yelp's blog, the team has made the same datasets available on the [Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset). This initiative has encouraged business owners or public users to conduct analysis and grasp insights from the data. However, it is still impossible for business owners to check and review all the business data before making a business decision. 

The purpose of this repository is to:
1) Demonstrate storage of Yelp JSON files using MongoDB and HDFS
2) Demonstrate access of Yelp JSON files from either MongoDB and HDFS to PySpark
